Repository: https://github.com/Noitome/MindMirror_Alpha1.02

This repository documents the original concept, design, and implementation of an adaptive, visual-first
goal & task mapping application ("MindMirror") authored by Daniel ("Author"). The system includes:
- A mindmap view of nodes (goals/tasks) with visual connections;
- A mirror view of dynamic bubbles whose size scales with time spent;
- Timers with subnode → parent aggregation;
- A dynamic alignment score reflecting time alignment with goals; and
- A combined view integrating mindmap + mirror.

The above constitutes the core inventive concept and expression embodied in this codebase and related materials.
